# curvilinear-homography
Implements 2D and 3D perspective transform between image and cartesian coordinate plane, and curvilinear to cartesian coordinate conversion. Useful for coordinate systems defined nominally relative to a single non-linear axis (e.g. roadway stations and mile markers)

Repo under construction. Eventually this repo will be a python-style package installable as:

pip install ... curvilinear-homography
from curvilinear_homography import CurvilinearHomography
